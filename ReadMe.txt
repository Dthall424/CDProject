	My Code Louisville Project:
	I decided to make a portfolio site that I can continue to modify and add works to in the future. My goal for the site is for practice in the short term, but as I
work to better my skills further as a developer, I want the site to turn into a collection of all my works or anything that I may help work on.


	Instructions:
1) Make sure all files with the .html extension are in the "HTML" folder

2) Make sure all files with the .css extension are in the "CSS" folder

3) Make sure all files with the .js extension are in the "JS" folder

4) Open the HTML folder

5) Right click on CLPro.html and mouse over "open with..."

6) Select your preferred broswer ( works with Chrome and Edge if not with yours )

7) Enjoy!
