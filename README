My Code Louisville Project

My project will form the foundations of my portfolio/resume website.
It will allow the user to view my works, see what im currently working on, and contact me if they need anything.

1. Make sure all files are in the same folder.

2. Open resume.html in google chrome or Microsoft edge.

3. Enjoy!
