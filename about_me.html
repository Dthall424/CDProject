From the time that I learned how to walk i've had a very strong interest in how things work, how they came to be, and why.
 This is why I've been drawn towards becoming a Software Developer,
 paired with the fact that video games and computers have taken over most of my free time since the launch of the original Playstation,
 I was destined to learn more at some point in my life.
